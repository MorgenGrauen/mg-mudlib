set_light()
***********


SYNOPSIS
========

   int set_light(int n)


DESCRIPTION
===========

   An object is by default dark. It can be set to not dark by
   calling set_light(1). The environment will then also get this
   light. The returned value is the total number of lights in
   this room. So if you call set_light(0) it will return the
   light level of the current object.



   Note that the value of the argument is added to the light of
   the current object.


BUGS
====

   This handling of light by the parser is inappropriate for most
   purposes: If you put a burning candle into a safe, the safe
   will start to emit light.
