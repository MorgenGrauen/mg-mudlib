DESCRIPTION
        Substitutions are very advanced.

        First a simple example:

        s/apa/bepa/
        This will substitue the 'apa' in current line to 'bepa'.
        If an 'p' is appended, you will also immediately see the result.

        1,$s/apa/bepa/
        Same, but all lines in file. Only first occurence on every line.

        Any character can used instead of '/':
        s!apa!bepa!g
        The 'g' specifies that all occurrences of apa on this line are
        changed to bepa.

        The pattern that are supposed to be replaced, can be a regular
        expression. See ed3 about that.
