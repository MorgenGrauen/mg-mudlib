SYNOPSIS
        Initialization of the master object.

DESCRIPTION
        As the lfuns which are called to initialize objects after a load
        are defined through driver hooks, and these hooks are cleared
        prior to a master (re)load, the first function called is
        inaugurate_master(). It's not very sensible to do anything earlier
        as the master is not recognized as such at that time, and so a
        number of (important) things would not work. Which lfun is called
        during runtime to reset the master also depends on the driverhook
        settings. Arbitrary actions may be done on a reset.
