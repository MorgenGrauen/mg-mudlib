SYNOPSIS
        object compile_object(string filename)

DESCRIPTION
        This function is caled if the interpreter cannot find the
        file for an object to be loaded. The master object has now
        the opportunity to return an object that will then serve as if
        compiled from the given filename.

        If 0 is returned, the usual "Could not load descr for" error
        will occur.
