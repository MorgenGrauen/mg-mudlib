SYNOPSIS
        void preload(string file)

DESCRIPTION
        Load the object with the given file name (which was returned by
        epilog()). It is the task of the epilog()/preload() pair to ensure
        the validity of the given strings (e.g. filtering out comments
        and blank lines). For preload itself a call_other(file, "???")
        is sufficient, but it should be guarded by a catch() to avoid
        premature blockings. Also it is wise to change the master's
        euid from root_uid to something less privileged for the time
        of the preload.

        You can of course do anything else with the passed strings -
        preloading is just the traditional task.
