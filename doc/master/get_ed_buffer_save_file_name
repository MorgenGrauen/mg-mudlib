SYNOPSIS
        string get_ed_buffer_save_file_name(string edited_file)

DESCRIPTION
        This function is called when an interactive user object is
        destructed or loses connection through remove_interactive()
        while editing with ed() the file edited_file (emergency save).
        this_player() is set to the object that lost connection.
        The function should return a file name for the emergency save
        file.

EXAMPLE
        string get_ed_buffer_save_file_name(string file) {
          return "/players/"+getuid(this_player())+"/.dead_ed_files/"
                 + explode(file, "/")[<1];
        }

        This breaks up file into its components and stores it in the
        user's emergency save directory under the file's basename.

SEE ALSO
        ed(E), destruct(E), remove_interactive(E), valid_write(M)
