SYNOPSIS
        string *epilog(int eflag)

DESCRIPTION
        Perform final actions before opening the system to users.

        The argument is the number of -e options that were
        given to the parser on the commandline. Normally it is just 0
        or 1. The function should return an array of strings, which
        traditionally denote the objects to be preloaded with
        master->preload(). Any other return value is interpreted as
        "no object to preload". The resulting strings will be passed
        one at a time as arguments to preload().

        preload(M), master(M)
