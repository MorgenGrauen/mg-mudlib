SYNOPSIS
        __INIT

DESCRIPTION
        This function is constructed automagically by the parser at
        compile time, if the parser was compiled with #define
        INITIALISATION__INIT. This function is not intended to be
        defined by the lpc objects, and never to be called from lpc
        objects. This man page is here just for completeness.
