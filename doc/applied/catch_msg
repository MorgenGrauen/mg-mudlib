SYNOPSIS
        void catch_msg(mixed *|struct|mapping|object msg,
                       object|lwobject obj)

DESCRIPTION
        When say(), tell_room() or tell_object() are used with a
        non-string as message, the value will be passed to catch_msg()
        in all living objects that can hear it, instead of writing to
        the user resp. sending to catch_tell(). This can be used to
        implement communication protocols between livings. The second
        argument denotes the object that has sent the message.

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.2.11 added tell_object() to the efuns calling this
        lfun for symmetry reasons.
        LDMud 3.3.686 added the use of a mapping/struct/object as message
        value.
